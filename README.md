"Title Case"

### Objectives

- The output should be a new string.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!

### Notes
